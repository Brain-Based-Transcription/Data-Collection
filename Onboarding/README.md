# ðŸ§  Data Collection Team Onboarding â€“ Brain-to-Text Project

Welcome to the **Data Collection** team of the Brain-to-Text project!

This guide will walk you through the tools, devices, and setup required to start collecting EEG data. Whether you're exploring hardware for onboarding or preparing to use our primary headset (Emotiv Flex 2), this document has you covered.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal of This Repository

This repository serves to:
- Help team members set up EEG hardware
- Standardize our EEG recording sessions
- Maintain good data hygiene and structure
- Provide tools for reproducible, well-labeled EEG collection

## ðŸ§  Devices We Use

### âœ… Primary Device for Research & Model Training:
- **Emotiv Flex 2**  
  Our main device for production-grade data collection. It provides high channel count and consistent signal quality for brain-to-text modeling.

### ðŸ§ª Onboarding Devices (For Learning & Exploration Only):
- **OpenBCI Cyton**
- **Unicorn Hybrid Black**

These are provided for training and experimentation purposes only. You're welcome to explore them to understand SDKs and signal patternsâ€”but **only Flex 2 recordings will be used in our core dataset**.
